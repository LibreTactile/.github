## Maintainers

Please consider that I am currently the sole maintainer of the project, and although I will try to keep it updated often, it might take me a while to get to your issues or contributions. However, I would be happy to accept anyone that agrees with the code of conduct as a maintainer, to help out with as much or as little as they want. You can send me an email at [LibreTactile](mailto:libretactile@gmail.com).

# Happy making!
