That is part of the charm, and the motivation for creating an open source project, the efforts of a group can benefit the general public, and others could build upon what’s already been done. “Standing in the shoulders of giants”, then again, whatever other people do with the project will bring something back to the project, be it contributions, improvements, innovative use cases or solutions, or simply awareness of the existence of the organization (which is vital for its longevity!). + ubuntu/solarpunk
After said technology is well enough implemented, the department will expand and create other branches to research other actuation technologies. These other projects will also be developed as modular as possible, so everything will be interconnectable, to maximize the reusability of components across branches, and across individual projects in these branches. However, as an individual contributor, feel free to develop on whatever branch sparks your passion, just note that others will be encouraged to focus their energies into a different part of the r&d, so there might not be as much support for your development yet.

The organization will have several repos. Starting with high level project repositories(such as VIAT , or unity tactio one) which will be built from the lower level repositories (or BASE modules).
