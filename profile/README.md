# Hi there üëã

[LibreTactile](https://www.libretactile.org/faqs.html) creates open-source touch-based technologies that make it easier and more natural for people to interact with computers.

## The birth of LibreTactile

As part of my (Juan Nino) PhD research, I'm developing assistive technology to help visually impaired people navigate the internet. A simple, affordable, and open-source tactile interface was not available in the market. So, [we](#research-team) created our own and decided to open-source it to help more people develop tactile interfaces for assistive technology, gaming, XR, VR, neuro-rehab, consumer electronics, and other fields. Libretactile is being founded to foster multidisciplinary collaboration and adoption of our assistive technology.

## A platform for community

Hence, LibreTactile aims to serve as a platform to connect academics, developers, users, and enthusiasts of tactile technology from different fields. We believe in the power, flexibility, innovation, and resilience that diversity brings into communities.

So we invite people from different backgrounds, nationalities, and interests (including assistive technology, UX/rehabilitation research, consumer electronics, designers, arts, XR, and gaming) to benefit from and contribute to the mission of this organization.

## Fundamentally OPEN

We encourage (but do not enforce) the use of permissive licenses (such as MIT, FreeBSD, CERN-OHL-P, etc.) so that everyone can use, share, modify, buy, sell, and spread the fruits of the community.

> You can learn more about our choice of license and the organization by reading the [FAQ](https://www.libretactile.org/faqs.html).

## R & D
While each of our projects has its unique characteristics, we prioritize the following design considerations during their development: 

1. _Equitable_, Creating technology that considers the diverse needs and perspectives of all people, especially those who are historically excluded. It involves collaborating with communities to understand their needs and incorporating their feedback into the technology design. 
1. _Open source_, Anyone in the world can build, support, improve, and sell the hardware so it can mature over time.
2. _Modular_, simple and scalable designs that allow for different configurations to build more complex tactile human-computer interfaces.
3. _Low-cost_, to make it easier for everyone to access our tactile gadgets.
4. _Easy to use_ for users, hobbyists, makers, technicians, clinicians, and researchers.
5. _Easy to build_ with basic software or electronic skills, tools, and components.
6. _Easy to modify_, to facilitate the implementation of new ideas.

## Our Projects
### tomat navigator
Repository under construction. You can read more information about the project in [my portfolio](https://www.juannino.dev/tomat.html) and the [project presentation page](https://societeinclusive.ca/en/projets/dispositif-assistance-navigation/) of our partner the Inclusive Society. 

‚ÄúTouch Matrix Assistive Technology Navigator‚Äù (tomat navigator) is an affordable, open-source assistive technology that uses AI and tactile technologies to make it easier and more natural for visually impaired users to navigate the internet. It works as a companion device for screen readers, providing an interactive non-visual representation of a webpage through audio-tactile feedback. It was codesigned with and for visually impaired screen reader users. 


### wearable sensations
Repository under construction.

"Wearable Sensations" is a tactile wearable interface based on the "Tomat Navigator." The wearable device lets you reposition the touch points to create custom sensory experiences for mobile and desktop platforms. The project is currently in its early stages of development with a specific focus on rehabilitation technology. We plan to make the design available for everyone to use and improve by making it open source.
