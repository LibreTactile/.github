# Hi there üëã

LibreTactile is an organization concerned with the research, development, diffusion of open source tactile technologies for human computer interaction.

Although we pay extra attention to development of assistive technologies, you will see the same technology being implemented in VR gaming and other fields. That's part of the charm of open source, after all :wink:

## The birth of LibreTactile

[We](#research-team) are developing [assistive technology](https://societeinclusive.ca/en/projets/dispositif-assistance-navigation/) for visually impaired people, and we noticed that there aren't many options for tactile interfaces, not even simple ones, and certainly not many inexpensive ones.  
So we decided to create our own and open source it to enable more people to develop tactile interfaces, to be implemented in assistive technologies, or any other field (gaming, XR, VR neurorehab, etc). Being such a large task that requires the resources and expertise from many different fields we decided to create an organization to help orchestrate the efforts.

## A platform for community

Hence, LibreTactile aims to serve as a platform to connect academics, developers, users and enthusiasts of tactile technology from different fields. We believe in the power, flexibility, innovation and resilience that diversity brings into communities.

So we invite people from different backgrounds, nationalities, and interests (including assistive technology, UX/rehabilitation research, consumer electronics, designers, arts, XR and gaming) to benefit from and contribute to the mission of this organization.

## Fundamentally OPEN

We encourage (but not enforce) the use of permissive licenses (such as MIT, freebsd, CERN-OHL-P, etc) so that everyone can use, share, modify, buy, sell, and spread the fruits of the community.

> You can learn more about the choice of license and the organization in general reading the [FAQ](/docs/faq.md).

## R & D

Although each project comes with its particularities, our projects are developed prioritizing the following design cosiderations:

1. _Open source_, which means anyone in the world can build, support, improve and sell the hardware so it can mature over time.
2. _Modular_, simple and scalable designs that allow for different configurations to build more complex tactile human-computer interfaces.
3. _Low cost_, to make it easier for everyone to access our tactile gadgets.
4. _Easy to use_ for users, hobbists, makers, technicians, clinicans and researchers.
5. _Easy to build_ with basic software or electronic skills, tools and components.
6. _Easy to modify_, to facilitate the implementation of new ideas.

> You can learn more about the research and development of our current and future projects in the [R&D](/docs/R-and-D.MD) document. (pending)

## Get in touch

If you need help building or modifiying one of our projects, or if you would like to encourage the team or join our efforts, you can get check out the [FAQ](/docs/faq.md), and join in the discussion (pending), or send an email to [libretactile@gmail.com](mailto:libretactile@gmail.com).

<!-- TODO:  manage discussions for organization and specific repos ...-->

Dont forget to read the [code of conduct](/docs/code_of_conduct.md) to understand the kind of open and welcoming environment we try to promote.

If you would like to contribute to the project, follow the [contribuiting guideliness](/docs/contribuiting.md).
We are a small team, made up mostly of academic researchers (I am currently the only developer), so any artist, writer, translator, tester, accessibility expert, researcher, developer maintainer or anyone who can (and wishes) to help is very much apprecited.

You can also show support for the project, through a financial contribution by using our github sponsor button (pending).

<!-- TODO:  add sponsor button, or something like that .-->
