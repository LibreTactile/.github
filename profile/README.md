# Hi there üëã

LibreTactile is an organization concerned with researching, developing, and diffusing open-source tactile technologies for human-computer interaction.

Although we pay extra attention to developing assistive technologies, you will see the same technology implemented in VR gaming and other fields. That's part of the charm of open source, after all. :wink:

## The birth of LibreTactile

[We](#research-team) are developing [assistive technology](https://societeinclusive.ca/en/projets/dispositif-assistance-navigation/) for visually impaired people, and we noticed that there aren't many options for tactile interfaces, not even simple ones, and certainly not many inexpensive ones.  
So we decided to create our own and open source it to enable more people to develop tactile interfaces for assistive technology or any other field (gaming, XR, VR neuro-rehab, etc). Because such a task requires the resources and expertise from different fields, we decided to create an organization to orchestrate these efforts.

## A platform for community

Hence, LibreTactile aims to serve as a platform to connect academics, developers, users, and enthusiasts of tactile technology from different fields. We believe in the power, flexibility, innovation, and resilience that diversity brings into communities.

So we invite people from different backgrounds, nationalities, and interests (including assistive technology, UX/rehabilitation research, consumer electronics, designers, arts, XR, and gaming) to benefit from and contribute to the mission of this organization.

## Fundamentally OPEN

We encourage (but do not enforce) the use of permissive licenses (such as MIT, FreeBSD, CERN-OHL-P, etc.) so that everyone can use, share, modify, buy, sell, and spread the fruits of the community.

> You can learn more about our choice of license and the organization by reading the [FAQ](/docs/faq.md).

## R & D

Although each project comes with its particularities, our projects are developed by prioritizing the following design considerations:

1. _Open source_, which means anyone in the world can build, support, improve and sell the hardware so it can mature over time.
2. _Modular_, simple and scalable designs that allow for different configurations to build more complex tactile human-computer interfaces.
3. _Low-cost_, to make it easier for everyone to access our tactile gadgets.
4. _Easy to use_ for users, hobbyists, makers, technicians, clinicians, and researchers.
5. _Easy to build_ with basic software or electronic skills, tools, and components.
6. _Easy to modify_, to facilitate the implementation of new ideas.

> You can learn more about the research and development of our current and future projects in the [R&D](/docs/R-and-D.MD) document. (pending)

## Get in touch

If you need help building or modifying one of our projects, or if you would like to encourage the team or join our efforts, you can get check out the [FAQ](/docs/faq.md), and join in the discussion (pending), or send an email to [libretactile@gmail.com](mailto:libretactile@gmail.com).

<!-- TODO:  manage discussions for organization and specific repos ...-->

Don't forget to read the [code of conduct](/docs/code_of_conduct.md) to understand the kind of open and welcoming environment we promote.

If you would like to contribute to the project, follow the [contributing guideliness](/docs/contributing.md).
We are a small team made-up mostly of academic researchers (I am currently the only developer). So any artist, writer, translator, tester, accessibility expert, researcher, developer maintainer, or anyone who can (and wishes) to help is very much appreciated.

You can also show support for the project, through a financial contribution by using our GitHub sponsor button (pending).

<!-- TODO:  add sponsor button or something like that .-->
